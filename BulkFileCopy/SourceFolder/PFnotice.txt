Dear All,
 
As part of PF circular attached we were deducting 1800/- on basic of Rs.15000/-  as part of Employee contribution. Now, as per the instructions of PF department PF to be deducted strictly on basic @12%component of the individual salary.
 
We are implementing the changes from the FY 2017 starting Payroll of April-2017 as per the guidelines of PF department.
 
Please co-operate for the change.
 
Thanks
Narsingam
